# ***Legal***
This software, in no way, is illegal. It's functions are legal in most countries (unless your country disallows card counting). Card counting **may** be against your casino's TOS, so make sure to read that before you play with this software. I am furthermore not liable for any losses of any kind from the use of this software. Please read ``LICENSE`` for more information on how you can use the source code.

# ***Skidding***
Like the license file says, you can totally skid this file, just don't be a dick *PLEASE*, developers don't like when you sell their stuff. It's not cool unless you give credit to the person who made the software.

If you sell this on a forum, PLEASE send me your forum post so I can see how it sells! Always interested to see people who can be able to sell my work.
